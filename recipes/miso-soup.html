        <h3>What is Miso Soup?!</h3>
            <p>Most Japanese meals are served with a small bowl of steamed rice and 
        a traditional Japanese soup called Miso Soup (味噌汁).</p>
            <p>Depending on the region, season, and personal preference, you can enjoy many 
                miso soup varieties in Japan. In addition to the classic tofu and wakame
                 combination I show you today, we also use different savory ingredients such as 
                 veggies, meat, and seafood to make the soup. </p>
